    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to get familiar with some basic methods for dimensionality\n",
    "reduction, complete you own implementation of the **Isomap algorithm** (in cooperation with *Multidimensional scaling*), experiment with its parameters and compare with other techniques of dimensionality reduction (**PCA**, **t-SNE**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to complete prepared Isomap implementation and inspect the mehods behavior. \n",
    "See **all** sections with `# TODO:`. \n",
    "Submit your solution consisting of both this modified notebook file and the exported PDF/HTML document as an archive to the courseware BRUTE upload system for the SAN course.\n",
    "The deadline is specified there.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will be working with are vector representations of words in a latent (unknown) high-dimensional space. This representation of words, also know as word embedding, differs from standard bag-of-words (BoW, TFIDF, etc.) representations in that the meaning of the words is distributed across all the dimensions. Generally speaking, the word embedding algorithms seek to learn a mapping projecting the original BoW representation (simple word index into a given vocabulary) into a lower-dimensional (but still too high for our case) continuous vector-space, based on their distributional properties observed in some raw text corpus. This distributional semantics approach to word representations is based on the basic idea that linguistic items with similar distributions typically have similar meanings, i.e. words that often appear in a similar context (words that surround them) tend to have similar (vector) representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speciffically, the data you are presented with are vector representations coming from the most popular algorithm for word embedding known as word2vec [1] by Tomas Mikolov (VUT-Brno alumni). *Word2vec* is a (shallow) neural model learning the projection of BoW word representations into a latent space by the means of gradient descend. Your task is to further reduce the dimensionality of the word representations to get a visual insight into what has been learned.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "You are given 300-dimensional word2vec vector embeddings in the file *data.csv* with corresponding word labels in *labels.txt* for each line. Each of these words comes from one of 10 selected classes of synonyms, which can be recognized (and depicted) w.r.t. labels denoted in the file *colors.csv*"
