## Simple linear regression
## Start with a basic regression using the lm(y ~ x, data) function
lm.fit <- lm(medv ~ lstat, data = Boston) # lstat gives the percent of households with low socioeconomic status in the neighborhood
## Understand the model
summary(lm.fit) # see the model
names(lm.fit) # get all component names of the lm model
coef(lm.fit) # see the coefficeints once more, same as lm.fit$coefficients
confint(lm.fit) # confidence intervals around these estimates
sum(residuals(lm.fit)^2) # RSS
sqrt(sum(residuals(lm.fit)^2)/(nrow(Boston)-2)) # RSE, it can be interpreted as the estimate of standard deviation of the noise in our model
plot(Boston$lstat, Boston$medv) # visualize the relationship between indep and dep variable
abline(lm.fit, col="red", lw=2) # visualize the fit
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit) # see the diagnostic plots
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(lstat=c(5,10,15)), interval = "confidence") # predict for three new neighborhoods including confints
plot(hatvalues(lm.fit)) # Leverage statistics can be computed for our predictors with hatvalues()
which.max(hatvalues(lm.fit)) # find the observation with the largest leverage
